Dice Game

Brief
There are two parts to this project:
	single player 
	multiplayer players

Single player dice game:
Roll the dice to begin the game.
The dice appears on the first roll.
Each time the dice is rolled the score adds up.
If the score passes 20, you win.
If you roll a 1 at any time, you lose and the game restarts.


Multiplayer dice game:
Rules are the same as the single player version, but you must display a dice for each player, and it must highlight the current player and keep their score.
